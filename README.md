# Local Splunk SOC Lab Demonstration

This repository contains the files used in my local Splunk SOC investigation lab.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a realistic log triage workflow using Splunk, including detection, analysis, alerting and incident documentation.

This lab was created to simulate how a SOC analyst investigates suspicious activity in a controlled local environment.

Repository contents
